        <h2>Experience with Computing</h2>

        <p>I haven't had much formal experience with programming yet, but I've always been drawn to technology and how it works. During my HSC, I took Industrial Technology Multimedia, which quickly became my favourite subject. I loved working on video editing and learning the process behind filmmaking, it showed me how creative and technical skills can come together.

That course also introduced me to programming. I found it challenging at first since I hadn't done it before, but once I got past the basics, I really started to enjoy it. It pushed me to think in new ways and sparked an interest I didn't expect. Since then, I've been excited to explore programming more deeply at university and in my future career. I know I'm still early in the journey, but I already see how powerful these skills can be, and I'm committed to building on them.</p>
