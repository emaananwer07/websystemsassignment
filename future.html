			<h1>Future Direction</h1>
			<div class="section-box">
				<h2>My Career Goals</h2>
				<p>I want to work in IT or computer science. Both fields rely on computing and need strong programming skills. With my degree, I'll use high-level programming to understand complex systems, build algorithms, and create real solutions. I'm keen to apply these skills to solve problems and help organisations work better.</p>

				<h2>Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
				<p>There are a few areas I want to focus on as I grow:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advanced programming (like Python and Java)</li>
					<li>Data analysis and how to work with large datasets</li>
					<li>Cybersecurity and how to protect systems</li>
					<li>Cloud computing tools like AWS or Azure</li>
					<li>Building websites and apps from scratch</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
				<p>I'm planning to build a few projects to put my skills into practice. These will help me learn more and give me something real to show on my resume. Some ideas include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A personal website or portfolio</li>
					<li>A small app or tool that solves a simple problem</li>
					<li>A dashboard that shows data in useful ways</li>
					<li>Automating boring tasks using code</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
				<p>In the future, I want to work in a role where I can keep learning and stay challenged. I see myself working in a team that builds useful tech, either in data, software, or systems. I also want to keep doing personal projects on the side, maybe even freelance or start something of my own one day.</p>
